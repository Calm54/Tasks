<h1> Q1. </h1>
Two separate projects exist: A and B. they are in two separate git repositories. 
Inside repository A is an audio subsystem that is updated frequently. 
Repository B would like to now also use this audio system. Describe how you 
would set up the repositories and build processes for A and B so that both 
repositories can use the audio subsystem. You can reorganise the projects, 
repositories and change the build processes for both projects however you see 
fit.
