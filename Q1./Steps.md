1. **Create a shared repository:** 
Create a new Git repository, which we'll call 
"SharedAudio." This repository will serve as a central location for the audio
subsystem code that will be shared between projects A and B. 
```
# Create a new directory for the Repo, navigate into it & initialize it..

mkdir SharedAudio
cd SharedAudio
git init
```
2. **Move the audio subsystem to the shared repository:** In this step, you'll transfer the 
audio subsystem code from repository A to the SharedAudio repository. You can 
achieve this by cloning repository A and copying the audio subsystem code into the 
SharedAudio repository. Alternatively, you can extract the audio subsystem as a 
separate component and initialize a new Git repository specifically for it, and then add 
it as a submodule to the SharedAudio repository. Make sure to preserve the commit 
history if needed, as it can be helpful for tracking changes and understanding the 
development of the audio subsystem.
```
# Clone repo A (if not already cloned)
git clone <repository_A_url>

# Navigate into repository A
cd repository A

# Move the audio subsystem code to the SharedAudio repository
git filter-branch --subdirectory-filter <audio_subsystem_directory> -- --all

# Create the SharedAudio repository
mkdir ../SharedAudio

# Navigate into the SharedAudio repository
cd ../SharedAudio

# Initialise the new Git Repo
git init

# Move the audio subsystem code into the SharedAudio Repo
mv ../repository_A/* .

# Commit the changes
git add .
git commit -m 'Moving audio subsystem code from Repo A'
```
3. **Update repository A:** Now that the audio subsystem has been moved to the 
SharedAudio repository, you need to update repository A accordingly. Remove the 
audio subsystem code from repository A and replace it with references or 
dependencies that allow repository A to utilize the audio subsystem from the 
SharedAudio repository. This could involve adding the SharedAudio repository as a 
submodule or referencing it as an external dependency. Additionally, adjust the build 
process of repository A to reflect these changes. For example, update build scripts or 
configuration files to include the necessary steps for retrieving and incorporating the 
audio subsystem from the SharedAudio repository during the build process.
```
# Navigate into Repo A
cd repository A

#Remove the audio subsystem code
git rm -r <audio_subsystem_directory>

# Update dependencies to use the SharedAudio Repo, if using npm package manager;
npm install --save <SharedAudio_repository_url>
```
4. **Add the audio subsystem to repository B:** In this step, you'll integrate the audio 
subsystem into repository B. Add the SharedAudio repository as a submodule. This inclusion allows repository B to reference and use 
the audio subsystem code. Similar to repository A, you'll need to adjust the build 
process of repository B to incorporate the audio subsystem properly. Update build 
scripts or configuration files to ensure that repository B can retrieve and integrate the 
audio subsystem from the SharedAudio repository during the build process.
```
# Clone repository B (if not already cloned)
git clone <repository_B_url>

# Navigate into repository B
cd repository_B

# Add the SharedAudio repository as a submodule
git submodule add <SharedAudio_repository_url> shared_audio
```
5. **Configure dependencies and build process:** Now that both repositories A and B 
reference the audio subsystem from the SharedAudio repository, you need to 
configure the dependencies and build processes accordingly. This step might involve 
modifying the project configuration files, build scripts, or package management files 
of both repositories. For example, if repository A and B use a package manager like 
npm (for JavaScript projects) or Maven (for Java projects), you would update the 
dependency declarations to specify the SharedAudio repository as a dependency. If 
manual build scripts are used, you would include the necessary commands or steps to 
retrieve and integrate the audio subsystem during the build process.
```
# Navigate into Repo A
cd repository_A

# Update build script or Config file, if using script (build.sh)
echo "command_to_build_audio_subsystem" >> build.sh

# Repeat same steps for repository B.
```
6.**Versioning and releases:** Establish a versioning strategy for the audio subsystem 
within the SharedAudio repository using Git tags. This strategy allows you to manage changes made 
to the audio subsystem and integrate them into both repositories A and B effectively. 
One commonly used versioning scheme is semantic versioning, where each release is 
identified by a version number (e.g., MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). You can define how 
changes to the audio subsystem impact the version numbers based on the nature of the 
changes. It's crucial to communicate and coordinate version updates between 
repositories A and B to ensure compatibility and proper integration.
```
# Navigate into the SharedAudio repository
cd SharedAudio

# Create a new tag for a release version
git tag <version_number>

# Push the tags to the remote repository
git push --tags
```
*Remember to define a versioning strategy and update the version number whenever changes are made to the audio subsystem*

7.**Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD):**The setup of CI/CD pipelines depends on the specific tools and platforms you use. Generally, 
you would configure the CI/CD pipelines for both repository A and repository B to handle 
building, testing, and deploying the code. These pipelines should include steps to fetch the 
audio subsystem from the SharedAudio repository and integrate it into the projects. You can 
use popular CI/CD platforms like Jenkins, Travis CI, GitLab CI/CD, or GitHub Actions to 
configure your pipelines.
The commands for configuring CI/CD pipelines vary depending on the platform and tools 
you choose.
