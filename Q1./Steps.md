1. **Create a shared repository:** 
Create a new Git repository, which we'll call 
"CommonAudioSub" this will serve as a central location for the audio
subsystem code that will be shared between projects A and B. 
```
# Create a new directory for the Repo
mkdir CommonAudioSub
```
2a. **Move the audio subsystem to the shared repository:** Transfer the 
audio subsystem code from repository A to the CommonAudioSub repository by cloning repository A and copying the audio subsystem code into the CommonAudioSub repository. 
For best practices, reserve the commit history this will be helpful for tracking changes and understanding the development of the audio subsystem.
```
# Clone repo A
git clone <repository_A_url>

# Navigate into repository A
cd repository A
```
2b. **Identify the audio subsystem code:** Locate the specific files and directories that comprise the audio subsystem code within the cloned repository by searching for audio-related file extensions such as .wav, .mp3, .ogg, or .pcm. Grep to search for files with these extensions. 
```
grep -r --include=*.{wav,mp3,ogg,pcm} "audiofile" /path/to/repository_A

# Navigate into the CommonAudioSub repository
cd ../CommonAudioSub

# Initialise the new CommonAudioSub Repo
git init

# Move the audio subsystem code from repository_A into the CommonAudioSub Repo
mv ../audiofile/* .

#Commit the changes
git add .
git commit -m 'Moving audio subsystem code from Repo A'
```
3. **Update repository A:** Now that the audio subsystem code has been moved to the 
CommonAudioSub repository, you need to update repository A accordingly. Remove the 
audio subsystem code from repository A and replace it with references or 
dependencies that allow repository A to utilize the audio subsystem from the 
CommonAudioSub repository. This could involve adding the CommonAudioSub repository as a 
submodule or referencing it as an external dependency. Additionally, adjust the build 
process of repository A to reflect these changes. For example, update build scripts or 
configuration files to include the necessary steps for retrieving and incorporating the 
audio subsystem from the CommonAudioSub repository during the build process.
```
# Navigate into Repo A
cd repository A

#Remove the audio subsystem code
git rm -r <audio_subsystem_directory>

# Update dependencies to use the CommonAudioSub Repo, if using npm package manager;
npm install --save <CommonAudioSub_repository_url>
```
4. **Add the audio subsystem to repository B:** In this step, you'll integrate the audio 
subsystem into repository B. Create a new directory within project B to accomodate the audio subsystem. This inclusion allows repository B to reference and use 
the audio subsystem code. Similar to repository A, you'll need to adjust the build 
process of repository B to incorporate the audio subsystem properly. Update build 
scripts or configuration files to ensure that repository B can retrieve and integrate the 
audio subsystem from the CommonAudioSub repository during the build process.
```
# Clone repository B
git clone <repository_B_url>

# Navigate into repository B
cd repository_B
mkdir shared_audio

# Add the audiofile from Repo A to the shared_audio directory in Repo B
git audiofile add <CommonAudioSub_repository_url> shared_audio
```
5. **Configure dependencies and build process:** Now that both repositories A and B 
reference the audio subsystem from the CommonAudioSub repository, you need to 
configure the dependencies and build processes accordingly. This step will involve 
modifying the project configuration files, build scripts, or package management files 
of both repositories. For example, if repository A and B use a package manager like 
npm (for JavaScript projects) or Maven (for Java projects), you would update the 
dependency declarations to specify the CommonAudioSub repository as a dependency. If 
manual build scripts are used, you would include the necessary commands or steps to 
retrieve and integrate the audio subsystem during the build process.

5a. Project A: Update the build configuration to exclude the audio subsystem and ensure it pulls the necessary dependencies from the CommonAudio repository.

5b. Project B: Adjust the build configuration to include the audio subsystem directory from the CommonAudio repository. Update the build scripts or dependency management systems to ensure they handle the shared audio subsystem correctly.

6.**Versioning and releases:** Establish a versioning strategy for the audio subsystem 
within the CommonAudioSub repository using Git tags. This strategy allows you to manage changes made 
to the audio subsystem and integrate them into both repositories A and B effectively. 
One commonly used versioning scheme is semantic versioning, where each release is 
identified by a version number (e.g., MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). You can define how 
changes to the audio subsystem impact the version numbers based on the nature of the 
changes. It's crucial to communicate and coordinate version updates between 
repositories A and B to ensure compatibility and proper integration.
```
# Navigate into the CommonAudioSub repository
cd CommonAudioSub

# Create a new tag for a release version
git tag <version_number>

# Push the tags to the remote repository
git push --tags
```
*RemThe commands for configuring CI/CD pipelines vary depending on the platform and tools 
you choose.
ember to define a versioning strategy and update the version number whenever changes are made to the audio subsystem*

7. **Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD):** The setup of CI/CD pipelines depends on the specific tools and platforms you use. Generally, 
you would configure the CI/CD pipelines for both repository A and repository B to handle 
building, testing, and deploying the code. These pipelines should include steps to fetch the 
audio subsystem from the CommonAudioSub repository and integrate it into the projects. Here, we can use CI/CD platforms like Jenkins or GitHub Actions to configure the pipelines.
