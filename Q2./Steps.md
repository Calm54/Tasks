To achieve this using GitHub Actions, we need to create a workflow that builds our project, 
generates the .pdb files, and then uploads them to an Amazon S3 bucket. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to accomplish this:
Step 1: Set up an S3 bucket
1. Log in to your Amazon Web Services (AWS) account and navigate to the S3 service.
2. Create a new S3 bucket or use an existing bucket where you want to store the .pdb 
files.
Step 2: Prepare your GitHub repository
1. Make sure your project repository is hosted on GitHub.
2. Add the necessary configuration files for GitHub Actions. Create a `.github/workflows` directory in your repository.
3. Inside the `.github/workflows` directory, create a new YAML file, e.g., `build.yml`, 
to define your workflow.
Step 3: Define the workflow In the `build.yml` file with the 
following steps:
In the workflow definition, define a job named "build" that runs on the latest version of 
Ubuntu. The steps in the job include checking out the repository, setting up the .NET 
environment, restoring dependencies, building the project, and finally, uploading the .pdb 
files to the S3 bucket using the `amazon-s3-upload` action provided by AWS.
Make sure to replace `<AWS_REGION>` with the appropriate AWS region where your s3 bucket is hosted, such as "us-east-1," and `<S3_BUCKET_NAME>` with the name of your S3 bucket.
Step 4: Commit the `build.yml` file to your repository and 
push it to the main branch. GitHub Actions will automatically detect the new workflow and 
start running it whenever there is a push event on the specified branch.
Once the workflow runs successfully, the .pdb files will be uploaded to the configured S3 
bucket. You can then access and download them for debugging purposes when needed.
Note: Ensure that you have properly secured your S3 bucket and restricted access to only 
authorized users or roles. We can use IAM roles and policies to manage access control for the S3 bucket.
