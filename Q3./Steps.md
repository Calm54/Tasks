To create a CMake project that processes IDL files and generates C++ files at build time, you 
can follow these steps:
1. Create a new directory for your CMake project. Let's call it `IDLProject.`
2. Inside the `IDLProject` directory, create a subdirectory called `idl`. Place your 
`Functions.idl` file in this directory.
3. Create another subdirectory called `src`, which will contain your C++ source files.
4. In the root of the `IDLProject` directory, create a CMakeLists.txt file. This file defines 
the build configuration for your project.
Here's an example of a CMakeLists.txt file:
```
cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.12)
project(IDLProject)

# Set the path to the prebuilt "IDLtoCpp" executable
set(IDLTOCPP_EXECUTABLE "<path_to_IDLtoCpp_executable>")

# Add a custom command to generate C++ files from the IDL file
add_custom_command(
    OUTPUT ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/src/Functions.cpp
    COMMAND ${IDLTOCPP_EXECUTABLE} ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/idl/Functions.idl
    DEPENDS ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/idl/Functions.idl
    WORKING_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/src
    COMMENT "Generating C++ files from IDL"
)

# Add the generated C++ file to the project's source files
set(SOURCES
    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/src/Functions.cpp
)

# Build the main executable
add_executable(IDLProject ${SOURCES})
```
*Make sure to replace <path_to_IDLtoCpp_executable> with the actual path to the "IDLtoCpp" executable.*

5. Save the CMakeLists.txt file.

#Install CMake command (if not already installed)

6. Open a terminal, navigate to the "IDLProject" directory, and run the following commands:
```
bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
This will create a "build" directory, generate the build files using CMake, and build the project using the "make" command.

7. After the build completes successfully, you can find the compiled executable in the "build" directory (or wherever your CMake build files are generated).

The CMake project will process the "Functions.idl" file using the "IDLtoCpp" executable and generate a C++ file, which will be compiled and linked into the final executable.

In this example, we define a custom command using add_custom_command. This command 
invokes the IDLtoCpp executable and specifies the input IDL file and output C++ files. The 
DEPENDS keyword ensures that the custom command is re-run whenever the IDL file changes.
The generated C++ files are then added to the MyApp target using add_executable. In this 
example, we assume a simple main.cpp file exists in the src directory.
Finally, we set the include directories for the target using target_include_directories to 
ensure the generated header file is accessible during compilation.
Note: Replace "path/to/IDLtoCpp" in the CMakeLists.txt file with the actual path to the 
IDLtoCpp executable on your system.
With this setup, when you build the project using CMake, the custom command will be 
executed, generating the C++ files from the IDL. The generated files will be compiled and 
linked with your main.cpp file, producing the final executable.
Remember to adjust the paths and filenames according to your project structure and file 
names.
