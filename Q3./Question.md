You have a project which contains a single "functions.idl" file. There is a prebuilt executable 
"IDLtoCpp" which exists that can generate a c++ file from the definitions inside of the "Functions.idl" 
file. Describe in detail a simple CMake project (you can use examples) which allows you to process 
these idl files and use the generated cpp files at build time.
